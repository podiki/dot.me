* Using tangle
Each (program, environment, etc.) configuration is generated by a ~README.org~ at the top level. By using tangle, this generates the configuration file(s) in the correct subfolder to be symlinked by stow.

Standard header for each is
#+begin_src org
  ,#+TITLE: Something configuration
  ,#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle "./.config/something/config" :mkdirp yes :comments both
  ,#+AUTO_TANGLE: t
#+end_src
with the package [[https://github.com/yilkalargaw/org-auto-tangle][org-auto-tangle]] providing a hook to org-mode file saving to tangle the file.

* stow
Files are linked using GNU stow, with the following configuration file

#+begin_src sh :tangle "./.stowrc"
  --target=$HOME
#+end_src
