* Using tangle
Each (program, environment, etc.) configuration is generated by a ~README.org~ at the top level. By using tangle, this generates the configuration file(s) in the correct subfolder to be symlinked by stow.

Standard header for each is
#+begin_src org
  ,#+TITLE: Something configuration
  ,#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle "./.config/something/config" :mkdirp yes :comments both
#+end_src
